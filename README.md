# Serial Data Processor

Captures data in the form of Comma Seperated Values from Serial and plots the graph.

This is extensively used for our ESP Line Following Robot / Buggy in which it was used to log and tune PID constants.

Currently, the usage of this code is currently limited only to the application of PID data.

However, adapting to different use case should be as simple as changing the variable names in the list.

## Features

- Automatic logging into a csv file into a /logs folder with date/time
- Live plot and latest data plot option
